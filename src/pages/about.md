#About Me
![](.jpg)
My name is Carter Cameron. I am currently studying economics and computer science at Truman State University. I am a member of the universities investment fund (https://bsif.truman.edu/) which analyzes, buys, and sells securities on behalf of the university. While I love personal finance and the stock market my true passion is cryptocurrency and my goal is to develop the crypto ecosystem to make it more usable in everyday life.
