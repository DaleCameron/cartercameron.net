# Economic and Computer Science Research
Economics is my primary discipline followed by computer science. This page  contains some of the books and research papers that I have read as well as some of the analysis that I have done.


## Written analysis
This paper was written for the Truman State Bulldog Student Investment fund for its quarterly Macroeconomic analysis. It was written in conjunction with other fund members. I was responsible for writing the Technology analysis as well as contributing to the U.S. analysis.
