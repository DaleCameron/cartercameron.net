# My Crypto Journey

My entry into Crypto
--------------------
My crypto journey started in 2016 when I first started following Bitcoin. Unfortunately I was not yet old enough to have a bank account or have the resources to mine. It took until I turned 18 for me to buy my very first piece of the emerging financial system. After that I was hooked, I began mining Monero on an unused Dell PC in the basement. I quickly expanded from there into the rig below that I now use to not only mine Monero but host this website and other things on ipfs, but also run a bitcoin validator node.

This Machine
------------
This machine which consists of a bunch of Dell desktops has taught me significant amount. It was my entry point into linux and the land of open source software.  It taught me about command line, networking, hardware,  peer to peer applications,crypto, programming, and problem solving.

Where I am now
--------------
I place a big emphasis on using the crypto ecosystem so for that reason I do not only hold coins but also spend them whenever I can. Projects and networks that I currently use include but are not limited to Bitcoin(which I run a full node), Monero(mining),Cardano,Ethereum(Including  polygon), and Nano(one of my favorites because it's easy to give to people who have no crypto experience). I also have played blockchain games such as Splinterlands and Zedruu as well as used personal test blockchains like ganache to deploy smart contracts.
